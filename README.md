# Topic Modeling on AirBnb reviews

For this project, I used Latent Dirichlet Analysis (LDA) to categorize AirBnb reviews from Denver (2012 - 2018) into 5 primary topics. Then, I used the topics as labels for supervised learning to classify review topics for 2019.

The idea behind this project is to give guests using AirBnb more control over their search. Instead of trusting host descriptions and reading countless reviews, my model builds a description of the property written by previous guests. Do guests prioritize location and walkability, or the responsiveness of the host? A tool made using this model could allow guests to surface properties with reviews that match their criteria.
